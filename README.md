## üí° Goals

- Learn and apply modern **C++23** (RAII, value semantics, templates, modules, etc.)
- Architect the projects with **test-driven development** and clean layering

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To set up the development environment (install `vcpkg`, dependencies, and configure the project):

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

If you're using Windows, open the `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` and run:

```bash
code .
```

There are multyple build modes available for building the project in debug, release, dist or test mode.
The project can be build with the desired build mode using the following commands:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh <debug/release/dist/test>
./scripts/run.sh <debug/release/dist/test>
```
